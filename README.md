# Google solution Challenge 2023
Welcome to Rebooked, a project dedicated to providing cheaper second-hand books to those who may not have the financial means to purchase new books.We understand that buying new books can be expensive, and not everyone can afford to do so. That‚Äôs why we have created a platform where individuals can donate their gently used books, and those in need can purchase them at an affordable price. By doing so, we hope to promote literacy, improve access to information, and create a more equitable society.
We believe that every book has a story to tell, and by sharing these stories, we can create a better understanding of the world and the people in it. With Rebooked, we aim to not only provide books, but also to foster a love of reading and learning, and to create a community of people who share this passion.

## About Project
Without a middleman or inventory, we want to build a platform that connects people who want to trade, buy, sell, or donate books. By collaborations with school and college administration, we seek to spread the word about the accessibility of low-cost books and emphasis the value of education and literacy. By making books more accessible and inexpensive, we hope to increase literacy rates and equip kids with the skills they need to excel in the classroom and beyond. Our platform encourages a more ecologically friendly approach to book consumption while being a cost-effective and sustainable means to provide access to books. We intend to reduce waste by enticing people to reuse and recycle books rather than buy new ones encourage everyone to live in a sustainable future.Overall, we are enthusiastic about the project's potential effects, the chance to increase disadvantaged school children' access to affordable books, and the chance to enhance their education. We want to leave a positive legacy that people and communities can take advantage of for years to come.

# Sustainable Development Goals targeted by us
</br>
<b> 1. No Poverty </b>
* Abject poverty perpetuates a disproportionate level of poverty, leading to ignorance. Especially, in a developing country like India factors like overpopulation, lack of awareness in rural areas and disparity in the availability of resources contribute to exacerbating poverty.

* Our application is one of a kind solution for eradicating poverty. The resources we intend to provide will not only improve their miserable plight but also make their lives more secure. It will ensure that basic amenities are provided free of charge and conveniently at their location. Aids in the form of food, clothing and essentials for survival will allow them to work for their betterment
<b> 2. Quality Education </b>

* There are hundreds of millions of children around the world who do not have access to basic education. The majority of poor households spend their income on necessities like food and fuel, and education is marginalized. Moreover, parents who have not received a proper education tend to underestimate the value of education and hesitate to spend money on schools.

* As a result of incorporating education quests in our application we developed an idea for educating those in need. In quest, we strive to enlighten the deprived section's future in a positive manner. They will be able to shape their identities as confident, literate individuals if they are educated and provided with the requisite resources. 
* Volunteers can contribute in this way regardless of any obstacles they have faced for a long time like being physically handicapped. Along with imparting basic education to the young generation and children, quests will also escalate about serious issues that are in dire need of being addressed. 



<b> 3. Reduced Inequalities </b>

* As a result of inequitable resource distribution, poverty has widened the gap between wealthy and poor. Because of inequality, poor people often face discrimination, stigma, and negative social stereotypes that limit their social participation, employment opportunities, and political support.
* With our application, we will assist those in need while preserving existing resources. In addition, instilling hope in them by informing them about the various schemes and opportunities offered by the government will encourage them to lead a better life. Participation in quests will also enliven social inequality. Having them publicly indulged will disintegrate the intersection of poverty and inequality.
